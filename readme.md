# Arduino TFT stopwatch

In my current internship, I'm encouraged to only work 8 hours per day. I often get taken away with my work and run above this limit. To solve this, I created a stop watch to track the amount of time I'm working. Press the green button to start the clock, and then press the red button to stop the clock. To reset the timer, press the reset button on the arduino
